    <h1>Privacy Policy | Stocky – Easy Inventory</h1>

    <p class="date-effective"><em>Effective date: June 14, 2025</em></p>

    <p>Thank you for using Stocky. Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how your

    <h2>2. Google Sheets Integration</h2>

        <li>Access is managed directly through Google's permission system and can be revoked at any time from your
            Google account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data entered in the app is stored locally on the user's device. It is not transferred to external servers or
        any third-party provider.</p>

    <h2>4. Children</h2>
    <p>The app is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from minors.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
